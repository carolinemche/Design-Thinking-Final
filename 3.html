  <p>
I would like to practice more on interviewing because from my experience in working on this project, interviews were the most valuable and exciting way to gather important information. In the span of my project, we interviewed about 6 people and we developed many interviewing skills along the way. And each interview was different because we kept improving after each one to see what questions worked, what didn’t, and what we should try. Especially during our first round user testing interviews, one thing we did not push for was for criticism and constructive feedback. In the second round, we built more rapport with our interviewees and stated clearly to them that we are designing the prototype for them and that we do not have experience in their roles. By doing this, we definitely got more critical feedback which allowed for us to improve and strengthen our prototype more. I really got to understand the importance of how interviews allowed us to understand customer’s experiences, emotions, and needs from a first hand account. Doing more interviews would help me improve on my interviewing skills and be able to produce more successful interviews that reveal more key insights. Definitely too, going back to my project, more interviews and reactions to our prototype would be extremely helpful in further iterations of the feedback platform.

    <h1> Design Thinking For Creative Problem Solving </h1>

  <h2>What was the most valuable part of the experience for you and why? </h2>

  <div id="info">
    <p>
      The most valuable part from my experience in this class was in general being able to work on a semester-long project. Typically in my other classes, the work being given was more assignment based. I would just be assigned something completely
      different and graded every week. If there was a project, it would not be something with a timeline as long as this class's project. I really valued being able to work into this semester-long project because it allowed for me to have the
      opportunity to go in more in depth on the content and build upon it every week. I was always used to learning in a class structure where each week's content was only applicable to the upcoming assignment rather than the content being applicable
      to the entire semester. The semester-long project structure allowed for me to always look back at certain lectures and contents from previous weeks since at times since the design thinking method is not necessarily linear and you definitely
      might have to go back to stages like insight refining and prototyping. In addition, a lot of the things assigned to me were more quantitative (ex. physics and statistics problems) and I felt like this project was more based on qualitative work.
      A lot of it was discovering facts and principles through various methods of research ranging from desk research to empathy interviews. The problem solving presented in this class required breaking down qualitative information that produced
      human centered solutions. Again, before this, I was used to just being given problems with numbers and asked to come up a numerical solution. It was really interesting especially to see the themes that my group had come up with be transformed
      into customer insights and how there were deeper problems and key tensions embedded within the themes. Overall, I really valued the structure of this class because the semester-long project kept me engaged with the amount of depth and skills it
      involved.

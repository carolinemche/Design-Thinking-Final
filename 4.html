    To continue on the Technology, Management, and Design minor, next semester I will be taking Service Design Innovation. This class focuses on products, services, and design and how to generate and develop human-centered policies. From reading the course description, I definitely see the design thinking methodology being applied to this class in the context of service. With that being said, I can use the interviewing, insight unlocking, and storytelling techniques being used during the semester long project. In addition, I am taking a User Experience Design class as well and it explores the relationship between humans and technology via interaction. Again, I can see myself using skills and methods learned in the class being applied since the process is human centered and focuses on creating meaningful user experiences and products. In addition, this class will require us to prototype interfaces so I can use the prototyping experience I gained in this class to my advantage.

Looking into my future career, I am not exactly sure yet what I want to do but this class has put working at an Innovation Firm under my radar! This was definitely one of my favorite classes Iâ€™ve taken this semester. I really enjoyed being able to use critical thinking to design for humans and would not mind if this was something I did as a consultant.

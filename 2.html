    The most challenging part of this class and semester-long project was definitely working in a group. As mentioned earlier, this was my first time working on something semester long, meaning I would be working with my group from start to finish. Another factor that played into it was that I was not choosing my group, rather choosing the topic I was interested in and being grouped with other students who were also interested in the same topic. Usually for group work that was being assigned to me, I had the opportunity to choose my group members so I usually worked with friends or people who I knew I would work well with. Because of this, I already had a good sense of my group’s work ethnic and behaviors as well as people’s strengths and weaknesses. For this project, it was definitely harder to understand the group dynamic so it was a challenge for me when it came to completing tasks for the project. One thing from the start that I noticed was that there was a lack of communication within our group. I felt like we were not all on the same page about things and everyone was kind of doing their own thing. In addition, when I asked a question I would not get a response for a while or I would be the only one adding work/information to the Mural board at times. I also felt like my group relied heavily on me which I thought was not that fair since this group project was a large portion of our grade and would be more effective if everyone pitched in. This showed too at the beginning of the project during group presentations and how we were unclear and all over the place with our ideas. I was able to help improve and make my group dynamic more effective though after doing some brainstorming and discussion (thank you for talking to me!). I decided to schedule weekly zoom meetings so that we could all work on the assignment at the same time and if there was a large portion of work we would split it up and assign work. By doing this, my group dynamic shifted and improved significantly. Because we spent so much time together on zoom too, we began better understanding our strengths and weaknesses and leveraged that into our project more.
